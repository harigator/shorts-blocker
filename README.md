# Shorts Blocker

This extension removes Youtube Shorts from everywhere; the home page, subscriptions page and even the search results.

## How It Works

It simply injects this [short CSS script](./css/blocker.css) when you browse Youtube.

## Requirements

* Chrome 105 and above (due to the [`:has` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has))
